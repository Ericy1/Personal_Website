        <h1>Fakebook: Full Stack Web Development<br></h1>
        <h4>JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, <br>Mongoose.js, HTML/CSS, Redis, Heroku, Surge</h4>
        <p1>
            Fakebook is a fully-functioning social web app with a variety of features built into it, including user
            registration, login validation, following friends, posting and commenting on articles, and customizing profiles. 
            The application uses HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the React Library for the frontend, a REST API for client-server 
            communication, Node.js/Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB/Mongoose.js for the database. Other web related 
            techniques include CORS, session ID management using cookies or Redis, secure hashed and salted passwords, and 3rd party 
            authentication. Test-driven development was applied to reach 80% code coverage. Unit testing was performed using 
            Jest, Enzyme, and Jasmine.

        <h1>RiceApps - Hatch<br></h1>
        <h4>React.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, GraphQL Playground</h4>
        <p1>
            RiceApps is a student-run organization that developes web apps for local communities of Rice and the 
            Greater Houston area. As part of RiceApps, I worked on Hatch, a Rice University scheduling app reaching 
            500+ student users. I helped develop the backend of a 4-year degree planner that allows students to 
            view their current schedule, add custom courses or notes, save a course, or modify individual semesters. 
            The technologies I used includesd React.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, and GraphQL Playground. RiceApps 
            has given me the opportunity to use new languages, frameworks, and practices in an agile team.

        <h1>My Website!<br></h1>
        <h4>JavaScript, HTML/CSS, GitHub Pages</h4>
        <p1>
            This website is a fun project I took on to learn more about front end web development. I built 
            it entirely from scratch, and it is deployed on GitHub Pages with the domain managed by Google Domains. 
            Along the way, I learned and applied cool techniques like preconnecting to links that contain lots of data 
            sent over the network, which significantly increased the loading speed of my photography page. I also found 
            a trick to easily fetch the data from my contact form and auto-populate it into a google sheet using a Google Apps 
            Script. The main page was the most fun to build, as I learned a lot how to make a visually clean and informative site.

        <h1>Java Game - Parametric Power<br></h1>
        <h4>Java, Java Swing, Object-Oriented Design</h4>
        <p1>
            This was a 2D Kinematics physics game I built that included an 
            interactive tutorial about kinematics, a quiz, and a real-time projectile 
            launching simulation. The game helps users learn about the basics of 
            real world physics, and primarily uses the Java Swing toolkit for the GUI.
